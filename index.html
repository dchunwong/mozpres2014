                    Hi my name's Dylan and I:

                    - am a WebQA intern this Summer
                    - am presenting Summer of WebQA: Testing, Dashboards and Labs. Oh My!
                    - will tell you about my experiences as an intern working at mozilla

                    ##What Did I do?  (・ヘ・)?
                    - Fix failing tests and add new ones to for Mozilla's websites and B2G. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                    - Buildout the on-device testing QA Lab in MV. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
                    - Make a quick dashboard for Jenkins B2G tests. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
                    - Talked to bots. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

                    Note:
                    I touched a lot of things this summer. I worked on:

                    - Improving and adding tests to Mozilla websites (Sumo, Amo, mcom, mozillians)
                    - Doing the same for Boot 2 Gecko (Firefox OS, troubleshooting on-device issues)
                    - Making a dashboard to track test health on Jenkins B2G tests. (Continuous Integration)
                    - Talked to bots

                    I worked on more than just testing websites like I expected.

                    Note:
                    Improving tests means:

                    - Fixing tests when they break (locator change to timing issues)
                    - Investigating Failures
                    - Adding more tests to cover new pages

                    I was pretty excited and nervous to start but ran into some roadblocks.

                    #Challenges
                    - Not used to existing codebase <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                    - Some things deeply abstracted away <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
                    - My own human error.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

                    Note:

                    - I had contributed a little before, but sometimes I ran into trouble where I wasn't sure what the test itself was doing. For example a compromise made at the time due to constraints I wasn't aware of.
                    - Sometimes I needed to dig deeper into py.test, but some tools abstracted variables away and I had trouble figuring out scope or where things came from.
                    - I made a lot of typos. And a lot of them slipped through and were pushed. Double checking is important! But it was also due to issues that I couldn't solve on my own due to my inexperience. Flashing devices etc.

                    #What'd I learn?

                    Note: 
                    I learned:

                    - There aren't any stupid questions. Don't be afraid to ask on IRC. People just want to help! I inherently have anxiety online, and I was originally intimidated to ask questions that I thought might be too basic, but that's the whole point of the internship right?
                    - Take a lot of opinions on the way. Getting reviews incrementally can let you do things right the first time.
                    - One and Done. Get all the info you need so you can do a task and not need to revisit it.

                    Note:
                    My other large project was building out the lab here in MV where:

                    - on-device testing is conducted for Firefox OS
                    - functional and performance tests are run
                    - Automated and run by Jenkins
                    - Phones are upside down, will explain later

                    Note:
                    Devices needed to be flashed with lates base images from vendors but some issues:

                    - Needed to be put into fastboot
                    - Needed to wait for tests to finish
                    - Newer scripts fixed this
                    - adb issues

                    - 26 flame devices, half and half, with 20 others on standby waiting to be setup.
                    - upside down due to space constraints. Fixing it.
                    - Tests actually failed
                    - Two devices per mac mini.
                    - Needed to juggle flashing ubuntu. Network boot.

                    Future:

                    - ammeters for power management
                    - more than two devices per mac mini
                    - an intermediate system to handle flashing of devices
                    - reporting to treeherder (TBPL replacement)
                    - JS tests.

                    Note: 
                    My final project was worked on as a longterm project. A dashboard to track the health of Jenkins B2G Tests

                    Note:
                    We want to easily see how tests are doing. If a test fails, is it intermittent? Or is it due to the update etc.

                    Jenkins has this but cumbersome. (Demo?)

                Note:
                ##Dashboard

                - Currently caches dictionaries used for visualization and shelves file
                - Will implement database
                - Would redo with angular rather than jquery, but libraries.
                - Want to add devices to data too, but more scraping
                - Quick lookup test health.

                ##Lab

                - Made a script to standardize setup
                - Puppet and other options are being looked into.
                - Network install took too long to setup with deadline

                ##Testing

                - Handled some issues, but mostly Jenkins and bugzilla
